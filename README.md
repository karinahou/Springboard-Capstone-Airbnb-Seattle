# Springboard-Capstone-Airbnb-Seattle

Airbnb changed the way people travel all around the world as they’ve begun to experience more of an “insiders” look into the cities they’re visiting. While looking into the growing city of Seattle, we can see which parts of the city are the most popular by number of bookings, the highest-rated, the most expensive or which time of year is the most popular or highest rated. A lot of these factors and lend itself to predict prices of the coming years for other travelers to find the best time of year to visit the city and to find the best place to see which can lead to a greater travel experience.
